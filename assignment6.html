  <p> The star fragment lamp was difficult to print with where my skill sets were at, and the amount supports it took to print the geometry gave me a hard time. So I settled with a simplier design.
   
</p>

<p> I created a tube that would hold onto the innards of the lamp base, I then created a bottom heavy bulb incasing so it would be easier to print</p>

<p> The lightbulb cover, I put a series of circles on top of one another then used the loft tool and offset function to create a printer friendly shape</p>

<p> Here are the prints of the base and bulb encasements. The tube part holds onto the lamp base. </p>

<p> Here's the final product, the lightbult encasing is then placed into the tube, as the geometry of the tube supports it </p>
