            <p> For this assignment I wanted to make a lamp based on a video game item called a star fragment from the video game animal crossing. I got an STL from the this website: https://www.printables.com/model/231726-star-fragment-like-in-animal-crossing-new-horizons.</p>

<p> I went to home depot and bought a LED lightbulb that can change colors via bluetooth connection with your phone. I made sure the base was the correct one being a medium/standard base, and measured the size bulb. I also wanted to have a standing lamp, so I bought a basic lamp base off of amazon.  </p>

<p> I then imported the star fragment model into rhino. I scaled the star fragment model to have the light bulb to be able to fit it into. Then I reduced the poly count of the mesh. Which is now roughly 500 polygons. I then boolean unioned a cylinder that would guide the lightbulb into the star Fragment. </p>

<p> I then imported a pedestal STL. The mesh was bad so I had to reduce it’s size. Going from 200,00 to 500 polygons. Then I turned the mesh into a polysurface.

<p> I then used the “Split” command to hollow out the star fragment and pedestal, by putting a cylinder through the geometry.
