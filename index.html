            My name is Ramadhan Malik, or just Rama! Coding has never been my strong suit, but in my defense, I was introduced to the programming scene by pretty terrible instructors. 
I currently work as a UX designer for Mount Sinai, I'm designing a tool that will help community based organizations write and spread accurate health messaging to the communities they serve. I'm really into VR, and I love designing games using the Unity engine to level design. 
		    Right now I'm doing a DRG with Elin Bjorling that foucses on creating a VR experience using hearing aid. I'm taking this class for multiple reasons: I've always wanted to make my own action figures, and I plan on working in the game's industry-I want to have some skills in
3D modeling.
