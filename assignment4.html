            <p> To start off, I created some sketches for what my box would look like. I drew out what the parts would look like</p>

</p>

<p> I then created each of the parts in rhino. I was very mindful of creating dogbones wherever I needed them so that it could be properly milled out. </p>

<p> Here's model exported over into the Bantam tools software, and an image for when I was milling out my pieces out of the Copper plates. </p>

<p> Here are these pieces milled out from the plate. Unfortunately, the slits that were supposed to hold these pieces in place were too small, so I might need to go to Rhino and increase the size of the holes. </p>
